PRELIMS 
Why did you choose this dataset?
As someone who enjoys gaming, I’ve always been curious about how it affects students’ school performance. I know that if gaming isn’t managed well, it might negatively impact grades. But I also believe gaming can help improve useful skills like critical thinking, quick decision-making, and reaction time—things people often don’t notice. By choosing this dataset, I wanted to explore if there’s really a connection between how much someone plays and how well they do in school.

What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?
In the single linear regression, I used the number of playing hours as the independent variable and grades as the dependent variable. In the multiple linear regression, I added more factors like how many years a person has been gaming, how many hours they play, what games they play, and their parents' education levels. The results didn’t show a strong or clear pattern. While some predicted grades were close to actual grades, the overall data was very scattered. This shows that gaming by itself doesn’t directly determine school performance—there are many other factors that influence a student’s grades.

How relevant is linear regression today?
Linear regression is still very useful in today’s world, especially in data science. It helps us understand the connection between variables, make predictions, and spot patterns in data. Even if it’s simple, it’s a great starting point when analyzing new datasets and exploring possible relationships.

Does preprocessing affect the result of the model? Why?
Yes, preprocessing has a big impact on the model’s results. It helps by cleaning the data and making it more consistent. For example, standardizing or normalizing the values ensures that the model treats all features fairly and performs better. Without preprocessing, the model might give inaccurate or biased results.

What is your conclusion based on the interpretation or result of your model?
The model was able to identify three clear segments in the real estate market: low-cost, mid-range, and luxury properties. These groupings were mostly based on price, not just the physical features of the houses. This insight is helpful because it shows that real estate strategies should focus on price levels when targeting buyers, rather than just looking at house size or number of rooms.
